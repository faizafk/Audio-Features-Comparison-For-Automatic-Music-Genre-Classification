# Audio-Features-Comparison-For-Automatic-Music-Genre-Classification

A comprehensive analysis is carried out to identify which set of features are the most effective and accurate for achieving classification. This comparison is mainly done to identify which among the following three features category helps in a good classification - using all time and frequency domain features, using only MFCCâ€™s and using only spectograms. 

To understand the ambiguity behind differentiating genres and classifying them, each model is also compared on the data comprising of the 30 second feature set and the 3 second feature set of the audio clip.

Machine Learning and Deep Learning models have been implemented and their hyper parameters have been improvised along with tweaks to the design of the model to identify which features contribute more towards accurate classifications. 

These proposed models are trained on GTZAN dataset and consist of audio file trains as well as spectogram trained models
